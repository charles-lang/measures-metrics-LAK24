# New Measures & Metrics in Education 
Workshop LAK24

Date:
Time:
Place: In-person, Kyoto, Japan

## Overview

Currently, new analytic measures remain siloed within institutions and companies [1,2,3,4]. As a result, they lack the testing and refinement that comes with broader exposure and input. This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners to facilitate collaborative ideation, refinement and dissemination of new measures and metrics in learning analytics.
