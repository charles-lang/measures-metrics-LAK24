<h1 align="center">Workshop on New Measures & Metrics in Education<br> LAK24</h1>


# Workshop Details 

**Date:**  Monday, March 18  
**Time:**  9:00am-10:00am  
**Place:** In-person, Kyoto, Japan  

## Overview

Are you investigating a novel educational measure? A new way to count student progress? A radical way to calculate attention? A creative adjustment to a socio-emotional metric? A KPI for classroom activities? The LAK24 Workshop on New Measures & Metrics is the place to be.

We're bringing together a smart, diverse crew of researchers and practitioners to hatch new ideas for educational measures and metrics. The goal? Move the needle on the devlopment and implementation of new ways of estimating important constructs in education.

## Get involved!

The key activity will be the presentation and discussion of particpant-submitted measures and metrics. Submit a measure or metric that you are currently working on or want to in the future! Submissions are short survey responses here. The most promising measures as voted on by partipants will recieve a $500 incentive to help move their work forward! 

*What is the difference between a measure and a metric? Good question and one we will dive into during the workshop. The two words are sometimes used interchangeably, but there is a general sense that a measure is a number and a metric involves more substantial processing of a measure.*
